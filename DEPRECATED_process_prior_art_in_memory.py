The sides and bottom of the glass are double-walled, forming an interstitial space for insulating purposes. The interstitial space can be left filled with air, or filled with an insulating material such as StyrofoamÂ®. The interstitial space not only reduces or eliminates condensation from forming on the exterior of the glass when filled with cold liquid on hot, humid days, but it also helps keep the liquid cooler. Alternately, when the glass is filled with hot liquid it also aids in keeping the liquid hotter, longer.",

The closure can help prevent any fluid leakage into and out of the insulating device if the insulating device is overturned or in any configuration other than upright. The closure also prevents any fluid from permeating into the chamber if the insulating device is exposed to precipitation, other fluid, or submersed under water. This construction results in an insulating chamber impervious to water and other liquids when the closure is sealed.",

The container, according to a disclosed embodiment, comprises a bottom wall and first and second upright, opposing side walls extending from respective edges of the bottom wall. First and second shell portions are connected in a pivotal manner to respective edges of the bottom wall. The shell portions are pivotable toward and away from each to close and open the container, respectively. When the container is closed, the stack is securely contained between the shell portions and the side walls for shipping or storing. When the container is opened, at least two opposing sides of the stack are exposed to facilitate removal of paper from the container. A handle for carrying or lifting the container may be coupled to one of the shell portions.",

The box is made from a blank having a first height measured between the outermost edges of the top and bottom flaps. The flaps are rotated into abutting contact with the exterior surface of the panels thereby reducing the overall height of the box to the height of the panel. Adjacent pairs of top and bottom flaps are provided with living hinges that enable them to remain in this position when the box is collapsed. The collapsed box is shipped through the mail in this diminished size and then erected into a box of the same height as the panels.",

The carton is constructed from a single, continuous blank of corrugated cardboard or other suitable material. The carton includes inwardly sloping side walls with support ledges to allow for easy stacking of the cartons. The side walls are of folded over design which provides the walls with a double thickness of material for added durability. The carton further includes a front window which provides convenient access to the food-stuffs stored within.",
